## Description of this app
This application shows places of interest around a location. It uses Google Maps API to display information about the location and calculates routes to the selected location.

## Download the Source Code
Download the ZIP file or from the terminal, run:

    'git clone https://github.com/ellenmliu/Neighborhood-App.git maps'

## Use
Open up 'index.html' in any browser. There should be 5 locations that shows up on the map. There is a draw tool that filters through the places within the shape, a search bar, powered by Foursquare, that gives venues based on the search input, and information box that shows up when you click on either the markers or the listings on the side.
